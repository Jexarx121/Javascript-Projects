    <h1>Cardinal Defense</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! The world has been overrun by mutants and you're in the crossfire, stuck with only a mythical barrier and your trusty rifle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To play this game, use the Arrowkeys and Spacebar. The former summons the barrier in the respective direction and the Spacebar fires your gun.
    </p>
    <p>
        There will be 2 types of mutants in this game followed by a boss, if and only if you survive the horde. The first few zombies you encounter, your gun
        will be <b>useless</b> against them so use your barrier. You'll encounter <b>armoured</b> zombies which your gun is the only effective means against them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As you defend yourself, more and more zombies will come, faster and faster so steel your nerves and ready yourself. Maybe you'll even survive the horde and encounter the boss.
    </p>

            (Boss will have different modes which you will have to use your barrier and gun as well)
